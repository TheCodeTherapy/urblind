# URBlind

## A lightweight zooming tool for i3-wm on X11, built with Raylib.

URBlind is a simple tool designed for i3-wm on X11, allowing you to zoom into portions of your desktop using the mouse wheel and pan with click-and-drag. I use it with a bind key to easily inspect details on my screen.

I first saw a similar tool being used with i3 on X11 during a Twitch coding livestream by a guy named Tsoding. I wasn't sure what software he was using, and I was too shy to ask, figuring that a hundred other people had probably already asked the very same question (which can be annoying). So, I decided to build my own.
